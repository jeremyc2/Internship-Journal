I have really enjoyed our conversations about what things we should talk about in each of our different meetings. We tend to have these conversations more and more often because we can be really good at going off on tangents in our meetings. For example, one time during Stand Up, we met for so long that we passed the hour we had the room reserved for and another group started coming in. Our manager has started talking about how Stand Up should be really brief and then any further discussion we need to have should be in a Parkling Lot meeting. These kinds of things things we have been talking about more and more often, and not only talking about Stand Up. I am a firm believer that meetings need to be brief and direct.
