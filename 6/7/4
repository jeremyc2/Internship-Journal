Recently I started work on a BVT test. The BVT was a high priority since we have been trying to get all the lanes the same. This has been a challenge because as we do the data ingention there are always unforseen hiccups that get in the way. Most of the problems we ran into had to do with our lanes being configured in different ways, even with all the efforts of our Dev-ops team to keep the lanes as identical to eachother as possible. We pushed to get the BVT done as soon as possible so that we could verify that everything was working properly in all the lanes once we finished. Today I finished the data validation portion of the BVT.
