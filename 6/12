The greatest part of my internship so far has been working with MarkLogic. I'm mostly doing validation with what is in the database, but some of the queries I build are rather complex. All of the queries we build in MarkLogic are in XQuery, so as I started off I dove right in to XPath. When I started this Internship I did not even know what XPath was, even having taken a few courses of web development. I was fascinated by all the ways to search for a string using XPath, and to weave my way through various nodes. Once I got really good at finding what I needed with XQuery FLOWR statements and XPath, Kieth informed me that while for small datasets XPath may be performant, cts:search is a much quicker way to query from a large database. This is even more the case when the database is indexed and optimized to a tee. The datasets we have brought over so far are only a fraction of the number of records we will have in our production lane when we start beta testing later this year. We have about half a million records in there right now, but that is less than ten percent of the data we will have.
