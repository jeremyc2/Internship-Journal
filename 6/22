I have been learning a lot about workplace politics and buisness procedures, documentation, and task management. We use JIRA to document, priotitize, and coordinate the workload as well as even push back against the business when they are just asking for too much for any given sprint. About four members of our team of ten had a meeting the other day led by Kieth, our lead architect, who is disgruntled about how we use JIRA. I agree that we aren't using JIRA the way it was designed to work. Kieth doesn't think everyone does equal portion of the work. This is because everyone rates their own tickets and some will rate the just a few tickets all really high, perhaps higher than they should be in order to appear to be doing a lot of work. Others will humbly do a lot of work but rate their work less than it is worth. I have learned from Kieth how there is a better process that would prevent this and involving people not scoring their own tickets.
