I feel like my internship is going well. I don't think I am learning as much as I might in a full semester of school, but what I'm learning is also very different from the kinds of things I learned at school. A lot of what I am learning is just how to work with other programmers in the workspace, which no matter how much classes try to set group work up so they mimic the workplace it feels very different. This also was my first introduction to working on a team where we follow the scrum method, although we have adapted it slightly from the traditional scrum method. I hear that many teams adapt the method as needed. There are many different kinds of workers on my team and it's great being able to work a little with each of them.
