Today I did even more refactoring of my test code, but at the end of the day I also got to run some scrips from our data ingestion playbook. Brian has been preparing me to take over on the data ingestion front since he will be gone until Monday of next week. This mostly involves spawning the tasks off on the task server one by one and waiting for one to finish before starting the next one. It's easy enough, but it just takes up time more than it should and that time might just be better spent doing something that will allow me to learn a new skill, or just practice my programming skills. I guess that just goes to show that not everything in even a job you enjoy is sunflowers and daisies. Some things are just busy work and there's not much you can do about it. I did really enjoy the part of the day when I was in the Java code trying to translate the JSON from my local drive into something I could read, work with, and manipulate in Java. That really turned out harder than it should have been, but I ended up using the GSON library. Hopefully tomorrow I can actually build the endpoint for the BVT tests like I've been meaning to do for the past few days.
