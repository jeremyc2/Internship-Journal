Today I worked on readying my code so that it can access the data it needs for the various tests without having to go into the database side in MarkLogic every time and get new data. I think later this week I need to put in some good comments and documentation into my code that will fascilitate it's use after I am gone. Everything I am doing will hopefully allow anyone to pull down my testing code from git and run each of the specific tests. It really should be that easy. I really enjoyed working with Brian more today, now that he has passed on some of the data ingest work on and can focus on QA. He really has some interesting insights and you can tell he wants to do it the right way and not just the quick way. I love it when he comes up with an idea that will allow me to further automate one of my tests. One of the things he is best at is following the correct process.
