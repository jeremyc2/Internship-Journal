Today was mostly a day full of refactoring. I have been making a lot of imporvements to my testing code from runtime optimizations to encapsulating away so that any changes I make in one place effect related code elsewhere. I have also been moving away from Selenium for all the test which do not require a web browser. This means that all my API tests which validate the JSON which comes back from HTTP Requests I have refactored to do in plain old Java. This is a much better way of doing things since I don't have to keep pinging the web browser to see if the response has come back. It is also possible since I figured out how to get the authentication to work correctly. It was tricky and required gathering the cookies from two seperate HTTP requests in order to get the cookie I needed for authentication. It would have been easier if I would have had someone familiar with the authentication the Church uses. Then I was able to abstract the authenticator I had found into it's own class.
