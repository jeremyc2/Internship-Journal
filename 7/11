There is a little bit of a fued at work between Steven, who used to be the architect, and the current architect, Kieth. Kieth was brought in temporarily from his Software Company, SureSoft. I have noticed that with so much tentions due to our Alpha release being pushed back a few weeks. Part of this is due to our late start. Today we discovered a bug which kept some of the images from displaying, and I was glad to be the one to fully investigate the issue on MarkLogic, and the one who discovered the root cause of the bug. This is definitely one of the worst times to discover such a bug. Kieth has really been pushing for better unit testing to catch bugs early on, and I'm sure this will make a good case for creating better unit tests in the future. Everyday I get a little better at MarkLogic. I think I'm just about as good as everybody else on the team. I really enjoy MarkLogic. I also built another Stress Test in Selenium today. I was able to confirm that we could get 200 full-sized images fully returned and loaded in about twenty seconds. It is a nice, well rounded test.
