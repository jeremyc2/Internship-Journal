It the first day of my internship and I am super excited, even with all the orientation they have new employees go through on their first day on the job. I am really looking forward to this opportunity. Not only will I be able to hone in on my programming skills, but I will also have the opportunity to contribute to building the Church. The ways the different Church employees contribute to building up the Kingdom of God was a major focus of the presentations. They also tell us that working for the Church is different than working for any other company. There are various times when I will pray with my team throughout the day, and we will even have frequent devotionals. I am excited to actually go to the Riverton Office Building tomorrow and meet the members of the team I will be working with for the next four months.
