Today I got to meet my team. They seem like a really nice group. With only about ten members on it in total, it looks like I will definitely get to know everyone pretty well. I like it like that. We have a front end guy, a data transforms guy, an architect, a project manager, a database pro, and a QA engineer. On top of that they tell me theres a guy who travels back and forth puting together feedback groups and negotiating requirements with the business. We also have an engineer who is a real pro with setting up the firewall, optimizing the network, performance and optimization tweaks and just the devops of keeping the enviormnent the same in all the lanes. It looks like I'll be working with a bunch of cool guys.
