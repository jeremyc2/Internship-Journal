	For the past couple of days I was working on getting everything up and running which included downloading all the software I needed and getting the permissions I needed. We ran into quite a few issues along the way having mostly to do with getting me the correct permissions. At the end of the day today I was finally able to get my hands on the code repository and look over what we were doing. Every once in a while the other developers would get in a discussion about how the app was to function. That was really helpful to get an idea of how the app works as they have been working on the app for years now and really have a deep understanding of everything going on. I was also able to look at some of the QA tools and play around with the different individual applications and utilities I will be using for the next 4 months.
